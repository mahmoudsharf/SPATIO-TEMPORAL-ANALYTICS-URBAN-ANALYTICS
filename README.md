Deliverables:
Start by performing the following three data cleaning tasks in OpenRefine using the parking-violation-small.csv dataset:
In the violation_time column, check if there are times that are invalid or blank (i.e., not a valid 12-hour clock time). Exclude these rows from the table. 
In the registration_state column, check if there are invalid state entries. If so, exclude these rows from the table. 
In the vehicle_make column, cluster similar items to make vehicle make labels consistent
Look for additional issues, fix and list them in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eqPPiGhWw6oteIS8Bgfbc-fBTJwKxKdiX9qSNMPMSMY/edit?usp=sharing
